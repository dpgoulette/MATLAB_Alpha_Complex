This code is under current active development.  Results are not guaranteed currently. (11/7/2014)

This repo contains a tool that allows you to work with alpha complexes in MATLAB.  The key to alpha complexes is to be able to calculate the value of alpha for which a particular 1D, 2D, or 3D simplex is added to the complex.  This code calculates the alpha value for every simplex in a 2D or 3D point cloud.
